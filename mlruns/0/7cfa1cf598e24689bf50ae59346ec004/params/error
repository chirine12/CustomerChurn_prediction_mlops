When an mlflow-artifacts URI was supplied, the tracking URI must be a valid http or https URI, but it was currently set to file:///home/chirine_ourari/shyrine_ourari_4DS5_ml_project/mlruns. Perhaps you forgot to set the tracking URI to the running MLflow server. To set the tracking URI, use either of the following methods:
1. Set the MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI environment variable to the desired tracking URI. `export MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000`
2. Set the tracking URI programmatically by calling `mlflow.set_tracking_uri`. `mlflow.set_tracking_uri('http://localhost:5000')`
